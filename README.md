# Face-Image-Classification

Image recognition is an interesting topic and I am excited to exercises deep learning techniques to recognize human face image using age, gender and ethnicity attributes. Sequential models with variety of input layers were tested using Keras while compiling the model. Final face recognition shows an excellent accuracy score and acceptable MSE.

### Data

Main data set is from UTKFace which has been downloaded and made it available to use. 27304 images with five columns, it was a reasonable size dataset. Features distribution and null/missing values were checked along with features relevancy. Keras / sklearn with Convolutional Neural Network models were used to perform the tasks.
 Random samples extracted from the data set
